# Cisco FMC 6.3 Certificate Install via CLI (if the web UI-based certificate import isn't working)
#
# This assumes the CSR generation has already been done within the FMC web UI.
#
# SSH into console, then:

cd /etc/ssl
sudo mkdir backup

# Backup original versions of server.crt and ca-cert.pem:

cp server.crt ca-cert.pem backup/

# Note: server.key file seems to be re-used whenever the CSR generation is done via the web UI. Lame.

# Replace server.crt so it contains the server certificate, as well as the issuing CA and the root CA certs all in a row (in that order).
# Then restart the web UI process
