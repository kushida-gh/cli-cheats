# VMware ESXi 6.7 Certificate Install (non-Self-Signed)
#
# Generate 2048-bit RSA key, create CSR, install certificate issued by a signing authority.
# Because self-signed certs are stupid. Especially those who blindly accept them.
#
# SSH into the host, then:

cd /etc/vmware/ssl

mkdir backup
cp rui.crt rui.key backup/

# You'll be asked for a passphrase, which we'll strip out later.

openssl genrsa -aes256 -out ruinew.key 2048

# Create a CSR:

openssl req -new -sha256 -key ruinew.key -out ruinew.csr -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=My Company Name/OU=IT Department/CN=vserver01.corp.mycompanyname.com"

# Note: if any string in the DN contains commas or other special characters, create a temporary OpenSSL config file with the "req" and "req_distinguished_name" sections.
# This will be necessary if, for example, the company name is "My Company, Inc." or similar with a comma in the string.

openssl req -new -sha256 -key ruinew.key -out ruinew.csr -config temp.conf

# Copy issued cert to this dir and save as rui.crt, overwriting self-signed cert.
# Include intermediate CA cert after the server cert in rui.crt

# Remove passphrase from private key

openssl rsa -in ruinew.key -out rui.key

# Restart management agents:

/etc/init.d/hostd restart
/etc/init.d/vpxa restart
