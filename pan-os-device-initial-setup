----- Get basic system info
show system info
show interface management
show system disk-space
show system files


----- Set system time so logs, etc. are timestamped correctly
set clock date 2022/01/31 time 01:15:00


----- Delete old log data, etc. which may be soaking up disk space
delete debug-log mp-log file *.1
delete debug-log mp-log file *.2
delete debug-log mp-log file *.3
delete debug-log mp-log file *.4
delete debug-log mp-log file *.old


-----  Generate this self-signed cert first for use later in the SSL/TLS Certificate profile to be used by the management interface; it's preferred to eventually get a proper cert signed by a trusted authority
request certificate generate ca yes name firewall-01.foo.corp.com certificate-name cert-firewall-01.foo.corp.com-2022-01-31 algorithm RSA rsa-nbits 4096

----- Secure copy Pan-OS image files, dynamic updates, etc. Example here is specific to OS software install
scp import software from myusername@10.1.1.21:PanOS_200-8.1.0
request system software install version 8.1.0
request restart system


----- Verify NTP sync status and peer(s)
show ntp
